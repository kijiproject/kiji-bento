/**
 * <p>A tool that reminds the user of an available upgrade to Kiji BentoBox. The information
 * about an available upgrade is taken from a file named <code>.kiji-bento-upgrade</code> assumed
 * to be in the directory specified by the command-line flag <code>--input-dir</code>. The period
 * between upgrade reminders can be configured with the command-line flag
 * <code>--reminder-period-millis</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The tool will check for an upgrade information file in the directory specified. This file
 * will contain a JSON representation of information for an upgrade,
 * which also includes a timestamp of the last time the user was reminded of the upgrade. If it
 * is time for an upgrade (as determined using the reminder timestamp in the JSON and the
 * reminder period specified) the user will be reminded, and the upgrade information file will be
 * rewritten with an updated timestamp.</p>
 *
 * <p>This tool is resilient to stale upgrade files, in that if the upgrade file contains
 * information for a version not greater than the current version, the user will not be reminded.
 * This tool also swallows and logs any {@link Exception} encountered while running. Clients of
 * this tool should ensure that logs are redirected to an appropriate location to ensure that
 * users are not unnecessarily bothered.</p>
